# Password Hashing Demo

## Goal

Provide a working demo that helps explain what hashing is, and how it's used
in password storage and identity verification.

## Rules

- Use only standard library

## Todo

- demonstrate basic hashing principles e.g. what does non-reversible function mean in practical sense
- demonstrate simple password storage with SHA256 sums
- demonstrate salting + nonce
- demonstrate output of different hashes
